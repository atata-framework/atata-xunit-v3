## SemVer

Atata Framework tries to follow [Semantic Versioning 2.0](https://semver.org/) when possible.
Sometimes Selenium.WebDriver dependency package can contain breaking changes in minor version releases,
so those changes can break Atata as well.
But Atata manages its sources according to SemVer.
Thus backward compatibility is mostly followed and updates within the same major version
(e.g. from 2.1 to 2.2) should not require code changes.
